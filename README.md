# E-Commerce-Store
I was interested in creating an application with front-end and back-end capabilities and created an E-Commerce store. Uses Entity Framework for database migrations. C# LINQ, middleware and server requests for backend integrations and Jquery for front end capabilities.
Written in ASP.NET with a controller, models, views layout.
Includes a Cart pane to add and delete products, an Admin panel to add, remove or edit products within categories. Also has a home page where one can click on an item and view the details and add it to the cart.
